				The Living Framework for Cooperative Games (LFCG), captures high-level structures
				encountered in cooperative games divided into Play Structure, Player Context and Forms of
				Cooperation; and includes a compendium of Cooperation Design Patterns. Ths framework is
				derived from a multi-step systematic analysis of 129 cooperative games with contributions of
				eleven researchers, and was <a

				LFCG is published as this web application to facilitate use and appropriation and can be
